# Artle projects
I decided to make a similar game to Wordle by creating a guessing game based on well known art from the Rijksmuseim API from Amsterdam.

The game starts by having the user guess the last name of the artist of a pixelated version of a piece of art, and if it's correct or wrong, the user will be taken to the info and results page, where they can see the painting and read additional information about it.

It is still in progress.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
